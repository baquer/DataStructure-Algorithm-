# DataStructure-Algorithm-
In this Repo i will explain the Data Structure and Algorithm in Swift Programming language

# Data Structure

Data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

**Linked List**

**Queue**

**Stack**

**Hash Table**

**Heap**

**Priority Queue**

**Trie**

**Tree**

# Algorithm

Algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithm is a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations.

**Searching :-**

**Linear Search**

**Binary Search**



**Sorting :-**


**Bubble Sort**

**Selection Sort**

**Insertion Sort**

**Heap Sort**

**Merge Sort**

**Quicksort**


# Big O Notation

**Order of growth of algorithms specified in Big O notation.**

**Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.**
